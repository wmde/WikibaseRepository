/**
 * Base database abstraction class to put stuff into that is not present
 * in the MW core db abstraction layer.
 *
 * Like to core class DatabaseBase, each deriving class provides support
 * for a specific type of database.
 *
 * Everything implemented in these classes could go into DatabaseBase and
 * deriving classes, though this might take quite some time, hence implementation
 * is first done here. If you feel like taking core CR crap and waiting a few
 * months, by all means try to get the functionality into core.
