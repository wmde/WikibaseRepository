Browser testing for Wikibase

You need to install Ruby and RubyGems (>=1.3.6)
Then run
(1) "(sudo) gem install bundler" to install bundler
(2) "bundle" in the /tests/selenium/ directory to install all necessary gems

Rename "configuration.yml.sample" to "configuration.yml" and
set configuration parameters to your needs before running the tests!

You need to have an administrator user and an ordinary user (which can be blocked
by the administrator) registered for the mediawiki instance you want to test
You have to set username and password of those users in your local configuration.yml

To run the tests, do "rake" at the top directory
