Browser testing for Wikibase

== Setup ==

You need to install Ruby and RubyGems (>=1.3.6)
Then run
(1) "(sudo) gem install bundler" to install bundler
(2) "bundle" in the /tests/selenium/ directory to install all necessary gems

Rename "configuration.yml.sample" to "configuration.yml" and
set configuration parameters to your needs before running the tests!

== Prerequisites for the MW instance you want to test ==

* You need to have an administrator user and an ordinary user (which can be blocked
  by the administrator) registered for the mediawiki instance you want to test
  You have to set username and password of those users in your local configuration.yml
* Make sure you clean the MW instance (no data items should be left)
  You can do this by running "php /lib/maintenance/deleteAllData.php" in the Wikibase extension.

== Running the tests on your local machine ==

* In configuration.yml set the WIKI_URL to point to your local MW instance you want to test
* From your command line, run rake[browser] in the selenium directory
  (where "browser" specifies the browser you want to use for the tests, e.g. "firefox" || "chrome" || "ie")
* Firefox (if installed) should work out of the box.
  For other browsers you should check the corresponding Webdriver on
  http://code.google.com/p/selenium/w/list

== Running the tests remotely via Selenium Grid2 ==

* In configuration.yml set the WIKI_URL to point to the remote MW instance you want to test
* Set REMOTE_SELENIUM_HUB to point to the Selenium Hub instance
* From your command line, run rake[browser,remote] in the selnium directory
  (where "browser" specifies the browser you want to use for the tests, e.g. "firefox")
