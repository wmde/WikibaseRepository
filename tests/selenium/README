Browser testing for Wikibase

== Setup ==

You need to install Ruby and RubyGems (>=1.3.6)
Then:
(1) run "(sudo) gem install bundler" to install bundler
(2) WINDOWS ONLY: install DevKit
	2.1 Download DevKit from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads
	2.2 Unzip it to C:\devkit
	2.3 Run "ruby dk.rb init" and finally "ruby dk.rb install"
(2) run "bundle" in the /tests/selenium/ directory to install all necessary gems

Copy "configuration.yml.sample", rename it to "configuration.yml" and
set configuration parameters to your needs before running the tests!

== Prerequisites for the MW instance you want to test ==

* You need to have an administrator user, an user which can be blocked during testing and an
  ordinary user (without admin rights) registered for the wikidata repo instance you want to test
  You have to set username and password of those users in your local configuration.yml
* Make sure you clean the MW instance (no data items should be left)
  You can do this by running "php /lib/maintenance/deleteAllData.php" in the Wikibase extension.

== Running the tests on your local machine ==

* In configuration.yml set the WIKI_REPO_URL to point to your local MW instance you want to test and
  WIKI_CLIENT_URL to the connected client wiki
* From your command line, run "rake run_tests[<taskname>,<browser>]" in the selenium directory,
  whereas <taskname> specifies the task to run, e.g. default (for all tests) or "label" for just the label tests,
  and <browser> specifies the browser you want to use for the tests, e.g. "firefox" || "chrome" || "ie".
* Firefox (if installed) should work out of the box.
  For other browsers you should check the corresponding Webdriver on
  http://code.google.com/p/selenium/w/list

== Running the tests remotely via Selenium Grid2 ==

* In configuration.yml set the WIKI_REPO_URL to point to the remote MW instance you want to test and
  WIKI_CLIENT_URL to the connected client wiki
* Set REMOTE_SELENIUM_HUB to point to the Selenium Hub instance
* From your command line, run rake[browser,remote] in the selnium directory
  (where "browser" specifies the browser you want to use for the tests, e.g. "firefox")

== EXAMPLE RUNS ==

rake
rake run_tests
rake run_tests[all]
this will run all tests locally in the browser you specified in configuration.yml as DEFAULT_BROWSER

rake run_tests[all,chrome]
this will run all tests locally in chrome

rake run_tests[label,firefox]
this will run the label tests locally in firefox

rake run_tests[all,firefox,remote]
this will run all tests on remote selenium grid hub in firefox

rake run_tests[description,chrome,remote,linux]
this will run the description tests on a remote linux box (if available) in chrome

rake run_tests[all,ie,remote,windows]
this will run all tests on a remote windows box (if available) in internet explorer
