/**
 * Tests for the ApiWikibaseSetAliases API module.
 *
 * The tests are using "Database" to get its own set of temporal tables.
 * This is nice so we avoid poisoning an existing database.
 *
 * The tests are using "medium" so they are able to run alittle longer before they are killed.
 * Without this they will be killed after 1 second, but the setup of the tables takes so long
 * time that the first few tests get killed.
 *
 * The tests are doing some assumptions on the id numbers. If the database isn't empty when
 * when its filled with test items the ids will most likely get out of sync and the tests will
 * fail. It seems impossible to store the item ids back somehow and at the same time not being
 * dependant on some magically correct solution. That is we could use GetItemId but then we
 * would imply that this module in fact is correct.

 * The database group has as a side effect that temporal database tables are created. This makes
 * it possible to test without poisoning a production database.

 *
 * Some of the tests takes more time, and needs therefor longer time before they can be aborted
 * as non-functional. The reason why tests are aborted is assumed to be set up of temporal databases
 * that hold the first tests in a pending state awaiting access to the database.
