/**
 * @covers Wikibase\Api\SetDescription
 *
 * The tests are using "Database" to get its own set of temporal tables.
 * This is nice so we avoid poisoning an existing database.
 *
 * The tests are using "medium" so they are able to run a little longer before they are killed.
 * Without this they will be killed after 1 second, but the setup of the tables takes so long
 * time that the first few tests get killed.
 *
 * @since 0.1
 *
 * The database group has as a side effect that temporal database tables are created. This makes
 * it possible to test without poisoning a production database.
 * @group Database
 *
 * Some of the tests takes more time, and needs therefor longer time before they can be aborted
 * as non-functional. The reason why tests are aborted is assumed to be set up of temporal databases
 * that hold the first tests in a pending state awaiting access to the database.
